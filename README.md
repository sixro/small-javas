# small-javas

A container of small Java objects.

This is not a project, but a sort of container of small Java objects. Every sub-directory is a very simple maven project containing one file (and probably one class but you can use inner classes).
This is not for any good reason, it is an exercise forcing me to write small objects with the purpose to create anyway some sort of value in that (the object can be use for real :D).
